# Feature Buttons Update - Home Screen Navigation

## ✅ Feature Buttons Now Fully Functional

The three feature cards on the Home screen are now clickable buttons that navigate to their respective screens!

## 🎮 How It Works

### Feature Card 1: Workout Library
- **Icon**: 🏋️ Fitness Center
- **Title**: Workout Library
- **Description**: Browse 15+ bodyweight exercises with descriptions
- **Action**: Click to navigate to the **Exercises** tab
- **What you'll see**: All 15 exercises with complete buttons

### Feature Card 2: Workout Generator
- **Icon**: ▶️ Play Circle
- **Title**: Workout Generator
- **Description**: Generate random workouts by time and difficulty
- **Action**: Click to navigate to the **Generate** tab
- **What you'll see**: Time and difficulty selection, then generated workouts

### Feature Card 3: Progress Tracker
- **Icon**: 📈 Trending Up
- **Title**: Progress Tracker
- **Description**: Track your weekly workout completion
- **Action**: Click to navigate to the **Progress** tab
- **What you'll see**: Weekly stats, bar chart, and reset button

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Changes Made

1. **Added setSelectedIndex() method to _MainAppState**
   - Allows changing the selected tab programmatically
   - Updates the UI when called

2. **Updated _buildFeatureCard() method**
   - Now accepts a `onTap` callback parameter
   - Wrapped in GestureDetector for tap detection
   - Provides visual feedback on tap

3. **Connected feature cards to navigation**
   - Each card calls setSelectedIndex() with the appropriate tab index
   - Home = 0, Exercises = 1, Generate = 2, Progress = 3

### Code Structure
```dart
// Feature card with navigation
_buildFeatureCard(
  icon: Icons.fitness_center,
  title: 'Workout Library',
  description: 'Browse 15+ bodyweight exercises with descriptions',
  onTap: () {
    // Navigate to Exercises tab (index 1)
    final mainAppState = context.findAncestorStateOfType<_MainAppState>();
    mainAppState?.setSelectedIndex(1);
  },
),
```

## 🎯 User Experience

### Before
- Feature cards were static information displays
- Users had to use bottom navigation to access features

### After
- Feature cards are interactive buttons
- Users can click any feature card to jump directly to that feature
- Provides a more intuitive entry point to each feature
- Faster navigation from home screen

## ✨ Visual Feedback

- Cards are wrapped in GestureDetector for tap detection
- Clicking a card smoothly transitions to the selected tab
- Bottom navigation bar updates to show the current tab
- Seamless navigation experience
